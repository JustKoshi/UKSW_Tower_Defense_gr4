This is our repo for this 3D game called RBTTD (Resource Based Tetris Tower Defence) in which main goal is to save your castle. You will need
to buy tetris blocks to block path of incoming waves of enemies as well as towers to kill them far away from main gate. Those defence blocks will
need to be bought with resource that can be made inside of the castle with lumbermills, quarries, fields etc. There are additional mini games to earn extra resources.
Game will be available to download from this link: https://bielak17.itch.io/rbttd
